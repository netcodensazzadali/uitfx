                      UITFX has taken further steps to ensure the protection of
                      its responsibilities towards Clients and other third

                      program offers cutting-edge coverage against errors,

                    <p>
                      UITFX has made the strategic choice to exclusively
                      collaborate with major global banks. Leveraging the
                      strength and international reputation of the UITFX brand
                      empowers the company to ensure liquidity through
                      well-established banking partners.

                    <p>
                      Funds belonging to our clients are directed into separate
                      bank accounts distinct from those utilized by the company.
                      These funds are entirely separate from the company's
                      financial records and cannot be utilized to settle
                      obligations in the unlikely event of the company's
                      default.

                    <p>
                      Given the inherent market volatility, UITFX's commitment
                      to negative balance protection guarantees that even during
                      highly turbulent market conditions, when margin calls and
                      stop outs may not operate as intended, no client will be
                      held responsible for repaying a negative balance.

                    <p>
                      UITFX consistently identifies, evaluates, and monitors
                      various types of risks associated with its operations.
                      This entails an ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of
                      the established policies, arrangements, and procedures.
                      This approach ensures that the company is well-prepared to
                      meet its financial obligations and capital requirements at
                      all times.
